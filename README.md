## Introduction

The Yellow Taxi Dataset Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into taxi ride patterns, trip durations, fare amounts, and other relevant factors. By leveraging various Python libraries, the project demonstrates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on yellow taxi trips, including pickup and drop-off dates and times, locations, trip distances, fare amounts, and more. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are utilized in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **DateTime**: For manipulating dates and times
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook includes various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset. This includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of trip durations, distances, and fare amounts
- Analysis of peak hours and days for taxi usage
- Correlation analysis between different features

## Usage

To run the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yellow-taxi-dataset-analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   '''bash
   cd yellow-taxi-dataset-analysis
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   '''bash
   Open the Jupyter Notebook Yellow Taxi Dataset Analysis.ipynb
4. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis.

## Results
The analysis results are documented within the notebook, showcasing various visualizations and insights derived from the data. Key findings include:
- Peak hours for taxi rides
- Distribution of trip distances and fare amounts
- Patterns in pickup and drop-off locations
